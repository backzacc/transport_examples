# Digi TransPort Python Scripting Examples

This repository contains examples for the [Digi](http://www.digi.com/) line of TransPort devices.

Due to the TransPort's limitation to only support 8 characters in the filename and 3 characters in the extension, all examples will have a valid filename to be directly placed on a TransPort device.

## Platform Specific Info

Some examples are platform specific, they will be labeled with the version of the TransPort, (e.g. WR11, WR21, WR31, WR41, WR44, etc.). The name of the folder within the project will include WR## in the name, for example `WR31/ex_gpio.py`.
