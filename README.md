Digi TransPort Python Scripting Examples
========================================

This repository contains examples for the [Digi](http://www.digi.com/) line of TransPort devices.

Platform Specific Examples
--------------------------

Some examples are platform specific, they will be labeled with the version of the TransPort, (e.g. WR11, WR21, WR31, WR41, WR44, etc.). The name of the script will include WR## in the name, for example `digital_io_wr31_example.py`.

Support and Contributing
------------------------

Contributions to the project are very welcome. Please submit any issues you
find to the [GitHub issue tracker][issues]. If you have a change you would like
to have included in the application, please submit a pull request against the
`develop` branch.

Application code on the `master` branch is of release quality and has been
code-reviewed and quality tested at the time of release. Any code added to the
repository between official releases can be found on the `develop` branch; code
on this branch has been code-reviewed but has not necessarily been fully
tested - use this at your own discretion.
