# Digi TransPort Python Scripting Examples

This repository contains examples for the [Digi](http://www.digi.com/) line of TransPort devices.


## Platform Specific Info

Some examples are platform specific, they will be labeled with the version of the TransPort, (e.g. WR11, WR21, WR31, WR41, WR44, etc.). The name of the folder within the project will include WR## in the name, for example `WR31/ex_gpio.py`.
