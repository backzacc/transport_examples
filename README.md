Digi TransPort Python Scripting Examples
=========================================


This repository contains examples for the [Digi](http://www.digi.com/) line of TransPort devices.

Due to the TransPort's limitation to only support 8 characters in the filename and 3 characters in the extension, all examples will have a valid filename to be directly placed on a TransPort device.

Platform Specific Info
-------------------------
Some examples are platform specific, they will be labeled with the version of the TransPort, (e.g. WR11, WR21, WR31, WR41, WR44, etc.). The name of the folder within the project will include WR## in the name, for example `WR31/ex_gpio.py`. 

Support and Contributing
------------------------
Contributions to the project are very welcome. Please submit any issues you
find to the [GitHub issue tracker][issues]. If you have a change you would like
to have included in the application, please submit a pull request against the
`develop` branch.

Application code on the `master` branch is of release quality and has been
code-reviewed and quality tested at the time of release. Any code added to the
repository between official releases can be found on the `develop` branch; code
on this branch has been code-reviewed but has not necessarily been fully
tested - use this at your own discretion.
